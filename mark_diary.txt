This is Mark's diary for the Git Usage assignment



This is the initial commit and day #1 for the Git Usage assignment.



This is day #2

Today is Tuesday. My invitation to my great classmate, Sven, did not play out well, even though I messaged him yesterday that I sent him the repository invite.
He even said "Okay" but did not accept the invite, which greatly saddens me.

In other news, I went to the Mcdonald's and gave both managers (who wrote me out of the schedule so that I could recover) a chocolate each.
They appreciated it quite a lot. I also got a Mcdonald's Tshirt and 25 euro bol.com gift card, which was an unexpected, but greatly appreciated gift.
