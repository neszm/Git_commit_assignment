This is Mark's diary for the Git Usage assignment



This is the initial commit and day #1 for the Git Usage assignment.



This is day #2

Today is Tuesday. My invitation to my great classmate, Sven, did not play out well, even though I messaged him yesterday that I sent him the repository invite.
He even said "Okay" but did not accept the invite, which greatly saddens me.

In other news, I went to the Mcdonald's and gave both managers (who wrote me out of the schedule so that I could recover) a chocolate each.
They appreciated it quite a lot. I also got a Mcdonald's Tshirt and 25 euro bol.com gift card, which was an unexpected, but greatly appreciated gift.


This is day #3

Today is Wednesday. I haven't done much today, but watched the MotoGP and ate some fries & snitzel. I might go and meet up with Goncalo later today.
Sadly, Sven still did not accept the invitation to the repository. 
For the group project resit, I have done my part: added all the chapters and added more than half of the Technical advice as well. Hopefully, everyone will do their part soon and we can be done!


This is day #4

This is a bit late. but I was busy all day so I sadly, forgot to do the commit earlier. Had a good day i would say, but kinda sad how much everyone else is caring about the resits.


This is day #5

Sven got the git assignment now as well so now we are doing great! Today is a free day I'll just be packing my bags, nothing else.
